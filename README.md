# IOT-Weather-Station
IOT Weather Station measuring wind speed and direction using:

* Solar Panel
* LiPo battery
* Battery Charger and 5v Regulator
* ATmega328p
* ESP8266

This is an embedded c++ microcontroller with power harvesting.  It can harvest enough power to operate indefintely.  Has information on dealing with intermittent atmega328p hanging due to RF noise and sharing a battery power supply with an ESP8266.
